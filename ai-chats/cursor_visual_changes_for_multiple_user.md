**User**

When a second user logs into FrontRow it looks like this. 

As you can see the second user's chair is yelllow and the first urser's chair has turned into a photocube

**Cursor**

Thank you for the screenshot and the description. Based on your observation and the recent code comments, here's what's happening and how to address it:

### Problem Summary
- The **first user's chair** is incorrectly displaying as a photo cube (instead of a blue chair with a photo cube above it).
- The **second user's chair** is yellow, which is likely correct (if that's the intended color for that seat), but the first user's seat should remain blue and not turn into a photo cube.

### Likely Cause
From the code review and comments, the intended design is:
- The **chair** (seat) should always be a solid color (blue, yellow, etc.), never showing the user's photo.
- The **photo** should only appear in the floating cube above the chair (the `PhotoCube` component).
- The chair should not be replaced by or turned into a photo cube.

If the first user's chair is turning into a photo cube, it suggests that the rendering logic in `SeatSelection.tsx` is conditionally rendering the `PhotoCube` in place of the chair, or the chair is being hidden/overwritten for the current user.

### Next Steps
1. **Review the seat rendering logic** in `SeatSelection.tsx`:
   - Ensure that the seat (chair) is always rendered as a solid color box.
   - The `PhotoCube` should be rendered above the seat, not instead of it, for any occupied seat.
   - There should never be a case where the seat itself is replaced by a photo cube.

2. **Check for conditional rendering** that might be hiding the seat for the current user or for any occupied seat.

3. **Verify the position and layering** of the `PhotoCube` so it doesn't overlap or replace the seat visually.

Would you like me to review the relevant section of `SeatSelection.tsx` and suggest a code fix to ensure the chair always remains a solid color, with the photo only in the floating cube above?

Please find the cause of the problem

I've carefully reviewed the relevant code and here is the root cause analysis:

---

## **Root Cause Analysis**

### **How the Rendering Works**
- In `SeatSelection.tsx`, for each seat, the following are rendered:
  1. **A seat cube** (always rendered, color depends on state: blue, gold, or darkred).
  2. **A PhotoCube** (only rendered if the seat is occupied).
  3. **Name text** (only rendered if the seat is occupied).

### **Key Color Logic**
```ts
const occupiedByMe = isOccupied && occupantSocketId === mySocketId;
const color = occupiedByMe
  ? 'gold'
  : isOccupied
    ? 'darkred'
    : isSelected
      ? 'gold'
      : 'blue';
```
- If the seat is occupied by the current user, it is gold.
- If occupied by someone else, it is darkred.
- If selected (but not occupied), it is gold.
- Otherwise, it is blue.

### **What Should Happen**
- The **seat cube** should always be visible and colored (never a photo).
- The **PhotoCube** should float above the seat, only if the seat is occupied.

---

## **What Might Be Going Wrong**

### **1. Visual Overlap or Transparency**
- The seat cube uses `opacity={0.9}` and is slightly transparent.
- The PhotoCube is rendered above the seat, but if the camera angle is low or the cubes are too close, the PhotoCube may visually overlap or blend with the seat, making it look like the seat itself is a photo.

### **2. Color/Opacity Confusion**
- If the seat is occupied by the current user, the seat turns gold, which is correct.
- If the seat is occupied by someone else, it turns darkred.
- The PhotoCube is always rendered above for any occupied seat.

### **3. No Code Path Replaces the Seat with a PhotoCube**
- The code always renders the seat cube, regardless of occupancy.
- The PhotoCube is only an additional element, never a replacement.

---

## **Why Does the First User's Chair Look Like a PhotoCube?**

- **Most Likely:** The PhotoCube for the first user is visually overlapping the seat cube below it, and due to transparency, lighting, or camera angle, it appears as if the seat itself is a photo cube.
- **The seat is still there, but the PhotoCube above it is visually dominating.**

---

## **How to Fix the Visual Confusion**

1. **Increase the vertical gap** between the seat and the PhotoCube so they do not overlap visually.
2. **Make the seat cube fully opaque** (`opacity={1}`) to prevent the photo from showing through.
3. **Double-check the z-order and positions** so the PhotoCube is clearly floating above, not intersecting, the seat.

## **Summary Table**

| Element      | When Rendered         | Appearance         | Problem?                |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Seat Cube    | Always               | Blue/Gold/Darkred  | Should never be a photo |
| PhotoCube    | If seat is occupied  | User's photo/video | Should float above seat |

---

**Would you like me to propose a code change to:**
- Make the seat cube fully opaque,
- Increase the gap between the seat and the PhotoCube,
- And ensure the PhotoCube never visually overlaps the seat?

This will resolve the visual confusion and ensure the seat always looks like a solid chair, with the photo clearly floating above.

```typescript
const occupiedByMe = isOccupied && occupantSocketId === mySocketId;
const color = occupiedByMe
  ? 'gold'
  : isOccupied
    ? 'darkred'
    : isSelected
      ? 'gold'
      : 'blue';
```

**User**

It is very clear that the photocube of the first user is being rendered twice, once where it should be and once either in place of the seat or overlapping it. See if you can find the cause.

**Cursor**

You are correct: the first user's PhotoCube is being rendered twice, and here's why:

---

## **Root Cause: Double Rendering of PhotoCube**

### 1. **SeatSelection.tsx**
- For every occupied seat, a `PhotoCube` is rendered above the seat (for **all** users, including the current user).

### 2. **UserView.tsx**
- When you are in `"user"` view (i.e., sitting in your seat), the `UserView` component is rendered.
- `UserView` renders a `PhotoCube` for **every other occupied seat** (i.e., `seat.id !== selectedSeat`).
- **It does NOT render a PhotoCube for your own seat.**

### 3. **What Actually Happens**
- In `"user"` view, both `SeatSelection` and `UserView` are rendered at the same time.
- `SeatSelection` always renders a `PhotoCube` for your seat (and for all other occupied seats).
- `UserView` renders a `PhotoCube` for all other occupied seats, but not for your own.
- **So, for your own seat, only `SeatSelection` should render the PhotoCube.**

### 4. **Why Does It Look Like Two PhotoCubes?**
- The only way your seat would show two PhotoCubes is if:
  - The `PhotoCube` in `SeatSelection` is being rendered at both the seat position and at the seat's base (i.e., the position for the seat cube and the position for the floating photo cube are the same).
  - Or, the `PhotoCube` in `SeatSelection` is being rendered at the wrong position for the current user.

---

## **What to Check in the Code**

- In `SeatSelection.tsx`, the `PhotoCube` for an occupied seat is rendered at:
  ```tsx
  position={[0, seatSize + seatSize/2, 0]}
  ```
  This should be **above** the seat, not overlapping it.

- In `UserView.tsx`, the `PhotoCube` for other users is rendered at:
  ```tsx
  position={[0, 0, 0]}
  ```
  This is at the seat's base.

---

## **Conclusion**

- **If you see your own photo at the base of your seat (not just floating above), it means the `PhotoCube` in `SeatSelection` is being rendered at the wrong position for your own seat.**
- **If you see your own photo both at the base and above, it means there is a logic error in the position or a duplicate render in `SeatSelection`.**

---

## **Next Step**

Would you like me to:
- Propose a code fix to ensure the `PhotoCube` for the current user is only rendered above the seat (never at the base)?
- Or, do you want a more detailed step-by-step trace of the rendering logic for your own seat?

```typescriptreact
  position={[0, seatSize + seatSize/2, 0]}
```

```typescriptreact
  position={[0, 0, 0]}
```
