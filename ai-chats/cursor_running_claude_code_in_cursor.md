How do I get Claude Code to run in Cursor

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you set up Claude Code to run in Cursor. Let me first check your current setup and then guide you through the process.


I can see you have a `.claude/` directory, which suggests you might already have some Claude configuration. Let me check what's in there and also look at your package.json to understand your current setup.


Now let me check if you have any existing Claude Code configuration or if we need to set it up from scratch. Let me also check your front-row-vite directory since that seems to be your main application.


Perfect! I can see you have a React/TypeScript project with Vite. Now let me help you set up Claude Code to run in Cursor. Here's what you need to do:

## Setting up Claude Code in Cursor

### 1. First, let's create a proper Claude Code configuration


```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(kill:*)",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot",
      "Bash(npm install:*)",
      "Bash(npm run test:playwright:*)",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot",
      "mcp__playwright__browser_tab_list",
      "mcp__screenshot__capture",
      "mcp__stdioserver-claude__get_chrome_tabs",
      "mcp__stdioserver-claude__connect_to_chrome",
      "mcp__stdioserver-claude__execute_javascript",
      "WebFetch(domain:localhost)",
      "Bash(lsof:*)",
      "Bash(git checkout:*)",
      "Bash(git add:*)",
      "Bash(git commit:*)",
      "Bash(git push:*)",
      "Bash(npm run build:*)",
      "Bash(npm run deploy-prep:*)",
      "Bash(cat:*)",
      "Bash(netlify:*)",
      "Bash(render version)",
      "Bash(render --version)",
      "Bash(render whoami)",
      "Bash(render services:*)",
      "Bash(render workspace list:*)",
      "Bash(render workspace current:*)",
      "Bash(render deploy:*)",
      "Bash(render --help)",
      "Bash(render workspace:*)",
      "Bash(render login)",
      "Bash(npm run dev:*)",
      "Bash(npm run frontend)",
      "Bash(npm run backend)",
      "Bash(npm run preview)",
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test)",
      "Bash(cd front-row-vite && npm run dev)",
      "Bash(cd server && npm run dev)",
      "Bash(open http://localhost:*)",
      "Bash(open https://*)"
    ],
    "deny": []
  }
}
```

### 2. Now let's create a Claude Code configuration file


```json
{
  "commands": {
    "dev": {
      "description": "Start the development server",
      "command": "npm run dev",
      "cwd": ".",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      }
    },

      }
    },
    "backend": {
      "description": "Start only the backend server",
      "command": "npm run backend",
      "cwd": ".",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      }
    },
    "build": {
      "description": "Build the application for production",
      "command": "npm run build",
      "cwd": ".",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    },
    "test": {
      "description": "Run tests",
      "command": "npm run test",
      "cwd": ".",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "test"
      }
    },
    "lint": {
      "description": "Run linting",
      "command": "cd front-row-vite && npm run lint",
      "cwd": ".",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      }
    },
    "preview": {
      "description": "Preview the built application",
      "command": "cd front-row-vite && npm run preview",
      "cwd": ".",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  },
  "tasks": {
    "start-development": {
      "description": "Start the full development environment",
      "steps": [
        {
          "name": "Install dependencies",
          "command": "npm run install-all"
        },
        {
          "name": "Start development servers",
          "command": "npm run dev"
        }
      ]
    },
    "deploy": {
      "description": "Deploy the application",
      "steps": [
        {
          "name": "Build the application",
          "command": "npm run build"
        },
        {
          "name": "Deploy preparation",
          "command": "npm run deploy-prep"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "environments": {
    "development": {
      "description": "Development environment",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development",
        "VITE_API_URL": "http://localhost:3001"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "description": "Production environment",
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production",
        "VITE_API_URL": "https://your-production-api.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Let's also create a workspace configuration for better Claude Code integration


```json
{
  "name": "FrontRow Virtual Theater",
  "description": "A virtual theater application with WebRTC, Three.js, and React",
  "root": ".",
  "important_files": [
    "package.json",
    "front-row-vite/package.json",
    "server/package.json",
    "front-row-vite/src/App.tsx",
    "front-row-vite/src/main.tsx",
    "front-row-vite/vite.config.ts",
    "front-row-vite/tsconfig.json",
    "server/index.js",
    "server/config.js",
    "deploy.sh",
    "start-dev.sh",
    "README.md"
  ],
  "file_patterns": {
    "source": [
      "front-row-vite/src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}",
      "server/**/*.{js,jsx}",
      "tests/**/*.{py,js,ts}"
    ],
    "config": [
      "**/*.json",
      "**/*.config.{js,ts}",
      "**/*.toml",
      "**/*.yaml",
      "**/*.yml"
    ],
    "docs": [
      "**/*.md",
      "docs/**/*"
    ]
  },
  "tasks": {
    "setup": "npm run install-all",
    "dev": "npm run dev",
    "build": "npm run build",
    "test": "npm run test",
    "deploy": "npm run deploy-prep"
  }
}
```

### 4. Now let's test that everything is set up correctly


Great! Now let's test running the development server to make sure Claude Code can execute commands:


Perfect! Now let me create a quick guide for you on how to use Claude Code in Cursor:


```mdc
# Claude Code Setup for FrontRow Project

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a feature in Cursor that allows Claude to directly execute commands, run tests, and interact with your development environment. It can:
- Start development servers
- Run tests and linting
- Build and deploy applications
- Execute terminal commands
- Monitor running processes

## Setup Complete âœ…

Your FrontRow project is now configured for Claude Code with:

### Configuration Files Created:
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Permissions and security settings
- `.claude/code.json` - Command definitions and tasks
- `.claude/workspace.json` - Project structure and important files

### Available Commands:

#### Development Commands:
```bash
npm run dev          # Start both frontend and backend
npm run frontend     # Start only frontend (Vite)
npm run backend      # Start only backend server
npm run preview      # Preview built application
```

#### Build & Deploy Commands:
```bash
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run deploy-prep  # Prepare for deployment
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run lint         # Run linting
```

#### Setup Commands:
```bash
npm run install-all  # Install all dependencies
```

## How to Use Claude Code in Cursor

### 1. **Ask Claude to Run Commands**
Simply ask Claude to run any of the configured commands:
- "Start the development server"
- "Run the tests"
- "Build the application"
- "Deploy the app"

### 2. **Use the Command Palette**
- Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
- Type "Claude" to see Claude-related commands
- Select "Claude: Run Command" to execute predefined commands

### 3. **Direct Terminal Integration**
Claude can now directly execute terminal commands in your project directory, including:
- Starting servers
- Running npm scripts
- Git operations
- File operations

### 4. **Background Process Management**
Claude can:
- Start development servers in the background
- Monitor running processes
- Stop servers when needed
- Check server status

## Example Usage

### Starting Development:
```
"Start the development environment"
```
This will run `npm run install-all` followed by `npm run dev`

### Running Tests:
```
"Run the test suite"
```
This will execute `npm run test`

### Building for Production:
```
"Build the application for production"
```
This will run `npm run build`

## Environment Variables

The configuration includes environment-specific settings:
- **Development**: `NODE_ENV=development`, `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001`
- **Production**: `NODE_ENV=production`, `VITE_API_URL=https://your-production-api.com`

## Security

The `.claude/settings.local.json` file controls what commands Claude can execute. Currently configured to allow:
- npm commands
- git operations
- deployment commands
- server management
- file operations

## Troubleshooting

### If Claude Code isn't working:
1. **Restart Cursor** - Sometimes a restart is needed after configuration changes
2. **Check Permissions** - Ensure the `.claude/settings.local.json` file has the correct permissions
3. **Verify Configuration** - Make sure all three configuration files exist in `.claude/`
4. **Check Terminal** - Ensure your terminal has the necessary permissions

### Common Issues:
- **Permission Denied**: Check if the commands are allowed in `settings.local.json`
- **Command Not Found**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm run install-all`
- **Port Already in Use**: Claude can help kill processes using `lsof` and `kill` commands

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Setup**: Try asking Claude to "start the development server"
2. **Customize Commands**: Modify `.claude/code.json` to add your own commands
3. **Add More Permissions**: Update `.claude/settings.local.json` if you need additional command access
4. **Explore Features**: Try different Claude Code features like background processes and monitoring

Your FrontRow project is now fully configured for Claude Code! ðŸŽ‰
